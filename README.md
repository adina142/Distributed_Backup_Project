# Distributed_Backup_Project
I am making Distributed Backup Project as my semester project for Design and Analysis of Algorithm.
**Project Overview**
The Distributed Backup System is designed to automatically detect file changes on a local machine and upload them to  backup servers for secure storage. The system is fault-tolerant, and capable of handling large volumes of data efficiently. It uses a client-server architecture where clients send files or file chunks to the server, which then manages the storage and retrieval of the files.
**Key Features**
File Change Detection: Monitors files for changes (using file timestamps or hash checks).
•	Distributed File Storage: Distributes files or chunks of files across multiple servers to balance the load.
•	Fault Tolerance: Replicates file chunks to different servers, ensuring data integrity even in the event of server failures..
**System Architecture**
**Client-Side**
The client is responsible for detecting file changes and uploading the relevant backup data to the server.
File Change Detection:
The client monitors file changes using file handling libraries that check timestamps or file hashes. When a change is detected, the client creates a backup of the updated file.
Backup Creation:
Files are serialized and split into chunks for efficient distribution across multiple servers. Along with the file data, metadata is sent, including the file’s name, size, timestamp, and hash.
**Server-Side**
The server is responsible for receiving, storing, and managing the file backups sent by clients.
Distributed Storage:
The server stores each file chunk in a distributed manner. This reduces the risk of data loss and ensures that no single server becomes a bottleneck. A hashing algorithm is used to assign chunks to specific servers. This allows the system to scale efficiently and balances the load across all available backup servers.
Fault Tolerance:
The system replicates each file chunk to ensure redundancy. If one server fails, other copies of the file chunk will be available from other servers. Data replication ensures that no single point of failure can cause data loss.
Load Handling:
The server uses multithreading to handle multiple file backup requests concurrently. Each incoming file chunk is processed in a separate thread, allowing the server to handle multiple clients simultaneously.
**Steps for Implementation**
File Detection and Backup Creation: Detect file changes using timestamps or hash comparison. On detecting a change, break the file into smaller chunks and send each chunk to the server.
Server-Side API:
Implement a socket-based API to handle incoming connections from clients.When a file chunk is received, the server stores the chunk in a distributed manner and tracks it by its hash or metadata.
Fault Tolerance: Implement replication of file chunks across multiple servers. If one server is unavailable, the system can still retrieve the file from another server where the chunk is replicated.
Load Handling: Use multithreading or asynchronous operations to ensure the server can handle a large number of incoming requests concurrently. Distribute the file chunks across servers using a load-balancing mechanism, such as hashing or round-robin routing.
**Optional Cloud Sync Scalability**
While the Distributed Backup System is capable of functioning in a local or small-scale setup, it can also be extended to the cloud for greater scalability and fault tolerance.
Cloud Deployment:
The server-side components of the backup system can be deployed to cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or DigitalOcean. Cloud services can be used to deploy multiple virtual machines (VMs) or containers that act as backup servers.
Horizontal Scaling: Cloud infrastructure allows for horizontal scaling, where more backup servers can be added dynamically based on the load. Cloud services like AWS EC2 or Google Cloud Compute allow automatic scaling based on the number of backup requests.
Replication and Fault Tolerance: Cloud storage solutions can provide automatic replication of file chunks to multiple locations to ensure redundancy. This reduces the risk of data loss due to server failure. 
Load Balancing: Cloud platforms offer load balancing mechanisms that can distribute backup requests evenly across available servers, ensuring that no server becomes overwhelmed with requests.
Backup Retrieval and Versioning: Cloud storage can be used to maintain long-term backup retention and versioning. Clients can retrieve previous versions of files even if they are spread across multiple servers.
